    intro: `If you are looking to publish your own audio or video podcasts, 
            you’ll need to rent space on a public web server to host the MP3 or MP4 
            files of your podcast. When someone subscribes to your podcast feed in 
            iTunes, or another podcasting app, the podcast media files will 
            download from this server to the user’s computer or mobile phone.
            Where do you host the podcast files? If you have signed up for a web
            hosting account, you can use the rented space to host the podcast files
            else you may consider using Google Drive - it is free, you can host both 
            audio and video podcast files and there are no known bandwidth restrictions.
