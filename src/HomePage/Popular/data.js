    description1: `The Secret Email System is a counterintuitive approach to creating and running an online business, specifically the freedom lifestyle business model, that allows you to build a sustainable and profitable long-term business that gives you freedom, fun, and adventure.
                   We achieve this by creating a “business machine” that works for you 24/7 where your only job is to oversee the system, not to create products, or services where you have to chase new clients or deliver to them.
                   And as a result…this frees you up to live and enjoy your life while the business works for you – this is the Secret Email System.`,

    He started in 2003. 
    In fact, in 2003, after he got started and got frustrated because he wasn’t as successful as he wanted to be so he decided to put his focus back on his job.
    In September 2019, Roberto made a decision and said to himself, “I’m just going to make this thing work no matter what.” Using the strategies, I’m going to tell you inside this ebook he ended up finally making it all work.
